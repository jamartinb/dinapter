In this example the main incompatibility to overcome is the fact that the server might reject the client. This makes them quite incompatible so Dinapter has a lot of troubles finding the right solution.

This example only works with the ''DinapterUnstableProperties.xml''. These properties make Dinapter faster, more risky, it will try to explore more deeply but it might miss the best solution or it might end in an explosion of states.
