This example is almost the same as ''e002'' and the complementary of ''e002b''. In ''e002b'' the login was split into two receptions and, in this example, it is only the client the one who has the login split. Some actions have been renamed as well to fit the article for CAMPUS'08.

This example works without problems but it usually returns 2 (out of 6) useless/empty solutions.
