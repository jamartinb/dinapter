In this example there are to reasonable big chunks of code divided by a PICK. Only one of those chunks is adaptable by the client and the main point of this example is whether Dinapter is able to recognize which side must be adapted.
This is a version of ''e004'' and ''e004b'' which tries to be compliant with the BPEL 2.0 specification. ''e004b'' failed to do so because of the main ''PICK'' in the server behaviour.

Today (8th January, 2009), in revision d89af4f740816ea7de91119a637003954fbc3958 , this example works ok returning 4 valid, but equivalent, solutions.
